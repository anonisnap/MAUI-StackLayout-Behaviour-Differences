# MAUI-StackLayout-Behaviour-Differences

This is a small and simple Repository with the sole purpose of holding code to show the different behaviour found in the StackLayouts from .NET MAUI

The different Views are
- [StackLayout](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/layouts/stacklayout)
- [VerticalStackLayout](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/layouts/verticalstacklayout)
- [HorizontalStackLayout](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/layouts/horizontalstacklayout)

The behaviour that is different is the `HorizontalOptions` and `VerticalOptions`
